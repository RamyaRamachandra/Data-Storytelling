# Data-Storytelling
### Introduction
A large production company, Spectacular Studios has been collecting data on the merits of thousand of movies that have come out in the past several years and the respective audience responses. The studio is unsure of what to do with the data they have from the movies dataset. As a data science consultant, you have been tasked to provide insights into a problem that matters to the company and on what they can take away from it. Your role is to define the problem that is compelling enough for the executive team to warrant taking action. From there, your role is to develop the storyline of what you can expect the data to tell you from your analysis. The executive team would like for you to walk through your recommendations and risks to the analysis that might affect your proposed action items. Your job is to provide their team with the final presentation, including an executive summary of key next steps.

Your role will be to develop a final presentation that is roughly 10-15 slides and provide a detailed analysis that digs into potential limitations and biases of the dataset youâ€™re working with.

### Project Overview
In this project, you will apply the skills you have learned in structuring a data story. You will have the ability to define your own problem statement, the analyses you would conduct to solve the objective and outline a set of potential solutions/actionable next steps for the target audience. You will combine the ghost deck and their analyses to provide a final recommendation. You will also need to identify the limitations and biases in data that affect the recommendations you provide.

You will conduct the EDA necessary to understand the dataset as a whole. The expected output will be to surface if the dataset is balanced if there are anomalies in the dataset that affect the applicability of the recommendation, and the final presentation itself that will be used for a mock recommendation to a management team.
